# CoronaVirusMortalityCalc

Data is from nychealth as of 5/27

Note: Calculations use all cases (closed and active), not just closed cases.
Also, this does not take into consideration asymptomatic patients. The idea was for this to 
be a machine learning project, however the data shared to the public is not ideal for 
a machine learning model. Hopefully as more data comes out, I can make an accurate machine
learning model.
